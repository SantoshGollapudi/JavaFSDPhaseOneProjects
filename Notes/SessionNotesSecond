Object Oriented Programming using Java:

	The key feature of OOPS is Data Hiding.

	In real time, every thing is object.
	
	Components:
	
		Classes
		Objects
		Encapsulation
		Abstraction
		Inheritance
		Polymorphism
		
---------------------------------------------------------------

	Class is a collection of data members(variables) and member functions(method).
	
	Object is a representater of a class that helps in accessings the members.
	Object is also known as part of class(Instance of a class).
	When we create an object of a class, memory gets allocated to data members.
	And Member Functions gets memory when they are called/Invoked.
	
	
----------------------------------------------------------------	
	
	Constructor:
	
	A special method used to initialize the data members.
	They have same name as that of class name.
	THey don't have any return type.
	We use them only for initialization Purpose.
	Constructors are called implcitly.
	
	Every class inherits the Object class by default.
	If we do not have any constructor, the default constructor to assign default values gets called from Object class.
	
	Types of Constructor:
	
		Default Constructor (Non-Parameterized Constructor)	
		Parameterized Constructor
	
	
-----------------------------------------------------------------	
	
	Access Modifiers: 
	
	
		They helps in Encapsulation and Abstraction.
		
		Encapsulation: This is the technique used to access restriction to class members and methods. A class is by default encapsulated always.
		
		Abstraction: A concept to abstract the hidden members and methods of a particualr class.
		
		Four Access Modifiers in Java:
		
			- Default: 
			
				Every member is by default 'Default'.
				Default Members are accessible from anywhere within the package.
				
			- Public
			
				Public members are accessible from anywhere.
				Within the class, 
				outside the class, 
				within the package and 
				outside the package
				
			
			- Private
			
				Private members are accessible within the class only.
			
			- Protected
			
				Protected members are accessible from child class.
